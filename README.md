# Project Website
### Group 1

The aim of this project is to create a website for the Programming Tools in Data Science course at the University of Lausanne.

This website provides support to a package that contains a shiny application that our group created. This website briefly explains our motivations, it contains:
- a video explaining how to use our shiny application
- a vignette in pdf format that explains how to install our package.

Our website was created with the blogdown package and uses the Hugo theme, more precisely "Ananke Gohugo Theme" from the followin github repository:"github.com/theNewDynamic/gohugo-theme-ananke".

Finally, this website is easily accessible as it is deployed with Netlify.

Here is the like to our blog website:
