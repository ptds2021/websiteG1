title: 'Covid-19 European Tracker'
---

Welcome to our blog. 


We would like to introduce a useful online interactive dashboard that visualizes and tracks confirmed cases of COVID-19 in real-time across Europe. This dashboard is intended as a user-friendly dashboard for researchers as well as the general public to track the COVID-19 pandemic and evolution since the vaccinations began. It is generated from trusted data sources and built in open-source R software (Shiny) providing transparency. Our aim is for users to have a set of relevant pages displaying key COVID-19 statistics interactively, like the ability to change the country, date, and statistics they wish to view.
